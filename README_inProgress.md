# Introduction
In the evolving world of digital interaction, traditional role-playing games like Werewolf
require a modern solution to bridge the gap between virtual and physical game spaces. Our
project seeks to digitize these beloved social activities, allowing users to engage in
immersive narrative-driven experiences from any location. By developing a web application
that supports game setup, role assignment, and real-time interaction through voice-to-text
technology, we aim to replicate the communal atmosphere of these games online. Utilizing
technologies such as React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, alongside
WebSocket for real-time communication and third-party APIs for voice recognition, this
project stands as a testament to the innovative application of web development skills and AI
integration. This initiative not only aligns with the course's focus on creating cutting-edge
web applications but also offers a solution to the limitations posed by physical distance in
social gaming.
